Hello, relatives! I shake your hand with a good heart. My name is Summer Dupree. I'm a Mnicoujou Lakota woman from the Cheyenne River Reservation. I'm currently a junior at Oglala Lakota College (OLC) majoring in conservation biology. I also work as a research assistant with OLC. My hopes for my work are to help preserve Uŋčí Makȟá (Grandmother Earth) and work to restore the balance between her and wičhása akáŋtu (human beings).

### More About Me
Núŋpa čhiŋkšiwičhawaye. I have two sons, 4 and 5, who are the motivation behind all I do. In my free time,  I enjoy being outside with them, walking, running, hiking, swimming, etc. I also like to read, listen to music, and I'm always up to learn something new!
